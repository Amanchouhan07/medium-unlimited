## Enhancing Blood Donation Logistics Through the Use of Online Blood Bank Management System in India



The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a 
web-based application that stores, processes, 
retrieves, and analyses data related to administrative 
and inventory management in a blood bank. This 
initiative intends to keep track of all information
about blood donors and the various blood groups
accessible in each blood bank, as well as to 
assist them in better managing their operations.
The goal is to increase transparency in this 
industry, making obtaining blood from a blood 
bank simple and free of corruption, and improve 
the blood bank management system. Instead of 
stocking blood, we are stocking information on 
blood donors for our client. Donors who want to
donate blood must first register with the database.
As a result, there will be no problems with the project. 
The CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and 
CMS (Content Management System) solutions are 
fully integrated within the programme. It is 
created in a way that is simple to use, saves 
time, and eliminates the need for manual labour.
The need for blood must be expressed, and we will 
provide the donor's information. Whether they are
available or not, donors can adjust their status.
